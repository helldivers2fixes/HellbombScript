## HOW TO USE:

1.) [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/releases) the latest **EXE** and run it.

Or, you can avoid using an EXE completely and [copy & paste the latest code directly](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript?tab=readme-ov-file#copy-and-paste-using-terminal-console-semi-automated) ‚ö†Ô∏è Latest code may have issues, so you may need to [select a release tag](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/tags) for it to run successfully.

2.) The menu uses letters to select choices. (Always start with ``H``.) Type ``H`` Press ``Enter`` to confirm the selection.

3.) Expect Administrator prompts depending on what you're doing. Check to make sure the prompts match what you wanted to do.

## Start by pressing ``Enter`` to run the default choice (``H``) or type ``H`` and press ``Enter``
### Read through **all** the output for anything that is a [FAIL] or looks incorrect.

Then you can work through the things below if you have specific issues.

| Symptoms          | Recommended Things to Try AFTER running ``H``                                  |

| **Abnormally** High CPU Usage  | Option ``G``                            |
| Memory Leaks      | Option ``S`` Note: If you have VRAM leaks instead, use [DDU](https://www.guru3d.com/download/display-driver-uninstaller-download/)                                                   |
| Out of Disk Space | Option ``S`` (Caused by memory leak overflowing to the page file)       |
| Total Game Reset (No progress loss) | Option ``C`` and Option ``M``        |

## Copy and Paste using Terminal Console (Semi-Automated)
 1. **Open** Terminal (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin) by pressing `Windows Key` + `X` and click `Terminal (Admin)` or `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`
 2. Copy (use the copy button on the far right) and paste the below line into Terminal/PowerShell and press ``Enter``
    ```
    Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/refs/heads/main/Hellbomb%20Script.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
    ```
    üí° It's always a good idea to read what you're executing. In this case, you're telling PowerShell to download the script text and then execute it.
    If you want to verify, paste the URL into the browser and it will reveal the raw script text.
     This  method has not been tested by the author, so you _may_ encounter weird errors.

## Copy and Paste using Terminal Console (Manual Method)
Copy and paste the script manually per instructions below.

 1. **Open** Terminal (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin) by pressing `Windows Key` + `X` and click `Terminal (Admin)` or `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`
 2. Middle/Ctrl + click on [the Hellbomb PowerShell Script](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/blob/main/Hellbomb%20Script.ps1) so that these instructions stay open
 3. **Copy** entire script by clicking the copy button in the top right by the script

 4. **Paste** into Terminal (Admin) or Windows PowerShell (Admin). Use ``Ctrl`` + ``V`` (Right-clicking in Terminal can cause errors!).
 5. Acknowledge the warning prompt and click **Paste Anyway**
 6. Press ``Enter`` until the program runs, and the menu appears (depending on how you paste you may have to press **Enter** a couple of times)         
 7. Choose a selection using the corresponding letters. (``H`` is always a good place to start.) Press ``Enter`` to confirm the selection.
 8. Expect Administrator prompts depending on what you're doing. Check to make sure the prompts match what you wanted to do.

## This program uses CPU-Z for some functions. Special thanks to Franck at CPU-Z for granting me permission to use it.
